Journal Entry Week 4

This Week started off with creating an HTML page for collecting billing information from the user. I then decided to jot down the books which will be displayed on the cart. Accordingly based on our database which is CoucDB, I have created a total of 32 documents which are inserted into the books table of our Backend DB in AWS. I then decided to begin my research on redis which we are planning to use in case of a session. The research work and sample code has been duly posted and this will be further modified once the whole app is integrated. I then decided to proceed with my work on the API’s assigned to me. I started off with making the view for order summary which will be displayed once the user check’s out. This page is driven by the order controller which has also been placed in the angularjs section. This will then utilize the Database results to get data from the customer and orders table and display the same to the user. The week was finally wrapped up with another short scrum meeting where we decided to integrate individual components and test the end to end application before the presentation. This will now include pushing all the front end to our heroku team account which will be linked to the pre-configured aws backed which has the different couchDB databases.
